# Snake  
Welcome to the repository for the Snake Project.  
  
The purpose of this project was to learn working with GUI and improve in java.  
  
_I realise now, that there are many things I could do differently to make the code more efficient.  
(for example I could use desktop pane instead of creating a new JFrame for every slide)  
But it served its purpose as I have much more knowledge about Swift now._  
  
  
*Red apples are for 1 point, Cyan apples are 2 points (They teleport you though!).  
Golden apple is the final apple, which appears once you have the required score.  *
  
I might add music and walls sometime later.
  
This is the idea right now. ðŸ¥·
