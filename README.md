# Snake  
Welcome to the repository for the Snake Project.  
  
The purpose of this project was to learn working with GUI and improve in java.  
  
_I realise now, that there are many things I could do differently to make the code more efficient.  
(for example I could use desktop pane instead of creating a new JFrame for every slide)  
But it served its purpose as I have much more knowledge about Swift now._  
  
  
  
What I plan to do:  
1: Display the score with some level of transparency  
2: 3 Different Levels  
  
  
  
This is the idea right now. ðŸ¥·
