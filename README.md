The purpose of this project was to improve in java and its frameworks for GUI (AWT, Swing).  

The backgroud pictures for the game and its levels were created using AI.
  
Note: I could use desktop pane instead of creating a new JFrame for every slide
  
  
**GAME RULES:**  
**Red apple is 1 point  
Cyan apples are 2 points, they teleport you though!  
Golden apple is the final apple, which appears once you have the required score**
