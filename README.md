# Snake  

The purpose of this project was to learn working with GUI and improve in java and its frameworks (AWT, Swing).  

The backgroud pictures for the game and its levels were created using AI.
  
Note: I could use desktop pane instead of creating a new JFrame for every slide
  
  
**Red apple is 1 point  
Cyan apples are 2 points (They teleport you though!)  
Golden apple is the final apple, which appears once you have the required score**
