# Snake  
  
  
This is the repository for the Snake Project.  
I made it for collaboration.  
  
I created a snake demo, which runs pretty well.  
There is also the intro-page, where you can start the game using a button.  
  
Right now, the game is set so that it restarts after death.  
What I have in mind to make the game better is creating a new Swing GUI Form - JFrame Form (the one I used to create the into-page) for the end of the game.  
There should be the score the player got and an option to play again.  
  
Another thing I want to change is to create different kinds of apples (bonus apples) and maybe walls, that would appear ocasionally for a limited time.  
It might be good to create a few levels for this (we could also use the form and buttons to run the specific level).  
  
This is the idea right now. ðŸ¥·
